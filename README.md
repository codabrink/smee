## Who is Smee?

Smee is a general assistant / vps service that does a handful of useful things for me.

- It's a telegram bot that mirrors audio and video using yt-dlp.
- It uses lets encrypt to create new certificates for it's own use with serving tls.
- It's an http proxy and cache for files to my backblaze b2 bucket. (Not s3 because b2 is cheaper and amazon creeps me out)
  - This is to make urls pretty (https://kota.is/abcde.png vs https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/i-kota/abcde.png)
- I'll probably add more features in the future.
